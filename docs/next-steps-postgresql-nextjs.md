## üéØ SUMMARY

Your current codebase provides a solid foundation but needs significant enhancement to meet production healthcare standards. The schema you've provided
represents a comprehensive, enterprise-grade healthcare platform, while your current implementation is at about 30-40% completion of that vision.

### Key success factors

- Prioritize security and compliance first
- Plan for database migration early
- Build incrementally with proper testing
- Focus on user experience in patient-facing features
- Ensure scalability from the start

The gap analysis shows you have excellent foundational architecture, but need substantial development investment to reach production healthcare platform standards.
