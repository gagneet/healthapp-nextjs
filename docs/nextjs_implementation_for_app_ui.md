## Fixed Configuration Files

### next.config.js

- Changed module.exports = nextConfig; to export default nextConfig;

### tailwind.config.js

- Changed module.exports = { to export default {

### postcss.config.js

- Changed module.exports = { to export default {

## The Issue

Your package.json has "type": "module" which tells Node.js to treat all .js files as ES modules. However, the configuration files were using CommonJS syntax (module.exports), which caused the error.

## The Solution

Converted all configuration files to use ES module syntax (export default) to be consistent with your "type": "module" setting.

## Run the app again

```bash
npm run start
```

The NextJS application should start without the module loading error.

## Note

The "type": "module" setting in your package.json is primarily for your backend Node.js server code. If you continue to have issues with the frontend, you could alternatively remove the "type": "module" from package.json and keep the CommonJS syntax in the config files, but then you'd need to update your backend server files to use CommonJS as well.

## Files Organized

Moved to docker/ folder:

- Dockerfile
- Dockerfile.backend
- docker-compose.dev.yml
- docker-compose.prod.yml
- docker-stack.yml

Updated script references:

- scripts/deploy-dev.sh - Updated all docker-compose references
- scripts/deploy-prod.sh - Updated Dockerfile and docker-stack.yml references
- scripts/reset-dev.sh - Updated docker-compose references
- scripts/backup-prod.sh - Updated docker-stack.yml reference

Config files remain in root:

- next.config.js, postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js stayed in root since Next.js expects them there

Current Clean Root Structure:

/home/gagneet/healthapp-nextjs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json, package-lock.json    # Package management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json                       # TypeScript config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ next.config.js, postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js  # Build configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md, LICENSE, CLAUDE.md       # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/                            # All Docker files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                           # Deployment/utility scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                              # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                               # Backend source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/, components/, lib/, types/     # Frontend Next.js code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx/, monitoring/                # Infrastructure configs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typings/                           # TypeScript definitions

The root is now much cleaner with Docker files organized in their own folder, and all script references have been updated to work with the new structure.

## Issues

### Accessibility Improvements

‚óè All accessibility issues have been fixed across the 4 files

Here's a summary of the changes made:

#### sidebar.tsx

- Mobile menu button: Added aria-label="Open navigation menu"
- Close button: Added aria-label="Close navigation menu"

#### doctor-sidebar.tsx

- Close sidebar button: Added aria-label="Close sidebar"
- Toggle sidebar button: Added aria-label="Toggle sidebar"

#### notification-drawer.tsx

- Close notifications button: Added aria-label="Close notifications"
