## Fixed Configuration Files

### next.config.js

- Changed module.exports = nextConfig; to export default nextConfig;

### tailwind.config.js

- Changed module.exports = { to export default {

### postcss.config.js

- Changed module.exports = { to export default {

## The Issue

Your package.json has "type": "module" which tells Node.js to treat all .js files as ES modules. However, the configuration files were using CommonJS syntax (module.exports), which caused the error.

## The Solution

Converted all configuration files to use ES module syntax (export default) to be consistent with your "type": "module" setting.

## Run the app again

```bash
npm run start
```

The NextJS application should start without the module loading error.

## Note

The "type": "module" setting in your package.json is primarily for your backend Node.js server code. If you continue to have issues with the frontend, you could alternatively remove the "type": "module" from package.json and keep the CommonJS syntax in the config files, but then you'd need to update your backend server files to use CommonJS as well.

## Accessibility Improvements

### ‚óè All accessibility issues have been fixed across the 4 files. Here's a summary of the changes made:

#### sidebar.tsx

- Mobile menu button: Added aria-label="Open navigation menu"
- Close button: Added aria-label="Close navigation menu"

#### doctor-sidebar.tsx

- Close sidebar button: Added aria-label="Close sidebar"
- Toggle sidebar button: Added aria-label="Toggle sidebar"

#### notification-drawer.tsx

- Close notifications button: Added aria-label="Close notifications"
- Mark as read button: Added aria-label="Mark as read"
- Delete notification button: Added aria-label="Delete notification"

#### patient-sidebar.tsx

- Close sidebar button: Added aria-label="Close sidebar"
- Toggle sidebar button: Added aria-label="Toggle sidebar"

All icon-only buttons now have proper aria-label attributes that provide discernible text for screen readers, resolving the accessibility violations.
