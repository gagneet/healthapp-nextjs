## Plan Overview

### 1. Data and Migration Strategy

Rationale
- The project spans multiple phases (1: safety, 2: Indian integration, 3: devices, 4: telemedicine/AI). docs/critical_medical_regional_enhancements.md emphasizes a Unified Migration Strategy so all features can coexist without schema resets. This avoids data loss and enables layered feature delivery.

Key Constraints
- Zero-downtime and schema drift management.
- Coexistence of Phase 1, 3, 4 now; Phase 2 to be added later.
- Prisma-first architecture with 46+ healthcare models; name consistency.

Proposed Changes
- Maintain a single, linear Prisma migration history that consolidates Phase 1, 3, 4; append Phase 2 when ready.
- Establish a “baseline” migration playbook for environments that predate migration files.
- Introduce schema-compatibility checks in CI that run prisma migrate status and fail on drift.
- Adopt namespace conventions for API routes: /api/safety/*, /api/devices/*, /api/consultations/*, /api/abdm/* to reduce coupling between phases.
- Create docs/prisma_migration_playbook.md with:
  - How to baseline an existing DB without destructive resets.
  - Environment matrix (dev, staging, prod) and approved commands.
  - Roll-forward only policy; emergency backfill guidance.

Success Measures
- No manual interventions during deploys (prisma migrate deploy succeeds consistently).
- Schema drift alerts in CI; no forced resets.
- New environments can bootstrap to full multi-phase schema from scratch.

### 2. Security, Privacy, and Compliance

Rationale
- HIPAA 2025 requirements, RBAC, audit logging, consent/OTP flows, and PHI protections are called out across docs. Indian ABDM adds regional-specific compliance later.

Key Constraints
- PHI at rest and in transit protections; least-privilege access; comprehensive audit trails.
- Consent-driven access to patient data; OTP verification flows.

Proposed Changes
- RBAC Hardening: Centralize authorization checks in API middleware; document a permission matrix by role and endpoint.
- Audit Logging: Ensure all safety-critical actions (drug checks, allergy edits, emergency alerts) emit structured audit events. Standardize log fields (actor, subject, purpose, outcome) and store hashed patient identifiers.
- Secrets Hygiene: Validate environment variables in startup; rotate secrets; protect .env files; use KMS/KeyVault for production.
- Data Minimization: Filter API response payloads to minimum required fields; apply field-level redaction in logs.
- Incident Readiness: Add breach response runbook (who, what, when, how) and tabletop test checklist.

Success Measures
- Periodic compliance checks pass (internal audit checklist green).
- Audit trails exist and are queryable for all PHI-sensitive endpoints.
- Static/dynamic scans show no secrets committed; env validation errors fail fast.

---

### 3. Device Integration (Plugin Architecture)

Rationale
- Phase 3 recommends a modular plugin architecture for devices to support different markets and evolving vendor APIs while keeping core lean.

Key Constraints
- Regional device approvals (FDA, CDSCO, CE) and optional bundles per environment.
- Real-time for critical vitals; polling for wellness data; mock modes for development.

Proposed Changes
- Implement /lib/plugins/core (DevicePlugin interface, PluginRegistry, DataTransformer) and configuration /config/device-plugins.json.
- Provide first-class mock plugins: mock-bp, mock-glucose for local/dev; verify data quality scoring and alert thresholds.
- Plan real plugins: wearables/fitbit (OAuth-based), medical-devices/blood-pressure/omron, wearables/google-fit, wearables/apple-health.
- Storage Strategy: Hybrid approach — core vitals table + plugin extension tables for device-specific metadata; align with Prisma schema already outlined in docs.
- Routing Strategy: Fixed prefix (/api/devices/{pluginId}/*) with plugin-registered subroutes.

Success Measures
- Plugins load based on environment config; development supports hot-swapping mock vs real.
- Device data visible in dashboards; alerts trigger per patient-specific thresholds.
- Adding a new device does not require core changes (open/closed principle).

### 4. Telemedicine, Labs, Analytics, Gamification (Phase 4)

Rationale
- High strategic value and largely independent of Phase 2. Enables revenue and clinical impact.

Key Constraints
- Secure WebRTC; prescription generation; lab ordering/results with partial regional variance; auditability.

Proposed Changes
- Telemedicine Core: Introduce video_consultations, consultation_notes, consultation_prescriptions models and Next.js API routes; ensure audit logging and RBAC.
- Lab Integration: Generic lab orders/results interfaces; adapters per provider later; results normalization and trend analysis scaffolding.
- Analytics & AI: Start with adherence dashboards and risk scoring placeholders; define event schema to feed analytics pipeline.
- Gamification: patient_game_profiles, game_badge_awards, game_challenge_progress models exist; implement awarding rules and UI hooks.

Success Measures
- End-to-end video consult flow with secure signaling and audit records.
- Lab orders created and results ingested via a provider-agnostic interface.
- Provider dashboard shows adherence KPIs; gamification events emit and persist.

---

### 5. Internationalization and Regional Integrations (Phase 2)

Rationale
- Indian market integration (ABDM, pharmacy, multilingual) can land after core platform features, per docs’ recommendation.

Key Constraints
- i18n framework that does not change API logic; regulatory compliance alignment; pharmacy network APIs.

Proposed Changes
- I18n: Integrate next-intl (or equivalent) with locale routing; seed Hindi and English first; key-based translation with medical terminology glossary.
- ABDM: Namespace /api/abdm/*; define consent, health ID linking, and data exchange endpoints; isolation from core safety features.
- Pharmacies: Adapter pattern for Apollo, MedPlus, Netmeds; use shared prescription DTO and map per provider.

Success Measures
- UI content switches by locale; no server logic changes needed.
- ABDM endpoints pass conformance tests; logs/audits capture exchanges.
- Prescriptions successfully placed via at least one pharmacy provider in staging.

---

### 6. Interoperability and API Contracts

Rationale
- FHIR R4 alignment and clean DTOs improve external integrations; existing api_integration_guide sets patterns for JWT, consent, and endpoint mapping.

Key Constraints
- Backwards compatibility for existing consumers; strict typing with Prisma/TypeScript.

Proposed Changes
- Define canonical DTOs for Patients, Medications, Vitals, Prescriptions aligned to FHIR where practical.
- Add versioned APIs: /api/v1/*; deprecate legacy as needed with sunset headers.
- Strengthen input validation (zod/yup) and response typing; central error envelope.

Success Measures
- Contract tests pass for critical endpoints; no breaking changes without version bump.
- External integration guide updated and followed by implementers.

---

### 7. Frontend UX and Accessibility

Rationale
- The project already achieved WCAG 2.1 AA for several components; standardize patterns and cover remaining surfaces.

Key Constraints
- Healthcare users include assistive tech; legal compliance.

Proposed Changes
- Establish accessibility checklist in PR template; add automated a11y tests to CI (axe, Lighthouse budgets).
- Standardize icon-only button pattern with aria-label and title; validate with Storybook a11y.
- Performance budgets for key pages (TTI/FCP) and skeletons for heavy dashboards.

Success Measures
- CI a11y checks green; Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 95 on major flows.
- Manual screen reader pass for dashboards and telemedicine UI.

---

### 8. Observability and Logging

Rationale
- docs/Issues_resolved_pending.md and accessibility_improvements.md document robust logging already added across backend and frontend.

Key Constraints
- Avoid PHI leakage in logs; enable distributed tracing; rate limiting.

Proposed Changes
- Centralize log sampling and sinks (file rotation locally; CloudWatch/ELK in prod); redact PII/PHI at logger boundary.
- Add request IDs and trace context propagation end-to-end (frontend → API → DB operations).
- Create operational dashboards for error rate, p95 latency, and alert rules.

Success Measures
- Correlated traces for key user journeys.
- Alerting in place for SLO breaches; reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR).

---

### 9. DevOps, CI/CD, and Deployment

Rationale
- Docker Swarm, environment management, and migration modernization are in place. We should codify and automate more checks.

Key Constraints
- Windows developer environments; consistent Prisma client generation; secrets management.

Proposed Changes
- CI: Add steps for prisma generate, migrate status, typecheck, eslint, unit/integration tests, a11y tests; block on drift.
- CD: Run prisma migrate deploy before app start; health checks for Next.js routes and DB; blue/green or canary for riskier changes.
- Environment: Harden .env management; provide .env.* templates; preflight script validates required vars.

Success Measures
- Green CI with all quality gates; zero manual fixes during deploys.
- Rollbacks are rare; when needed, automated, and documented.

---

### 10. Analytics and Reporting

Rationale
- Business requirements emphasize adherence analytics, clinical KPIs, and outcome tracking.

Key Constraints
- Accurate event instrumentation; privacy-preserving aggregation.

Proposed Changes
- Define analytics event schema (adherence events, device readings, telemedicine interactions); central collector.
- Provider dashboards for adherence risk tiers; patient trend visualizations.
- Consider warehouse/BI integration (dbt/BigQuery/Redshift) with PHI minimization.

Success Measures
- Providers can identify at-risk patients; measurable adherence improvements.
- Event coverage ≥ 90% for critical flows.

---

### 11. Testing and Quality Engineering

Rationale
- Complex, multi-phase system needs robust automated tests to avoid regressions.

Key Constraints
- Protected data; test data realism; device mocks.

Proposed Changes
- Contract tests for API; unit tests for services; integration tests for critical flows (consent OTP, emergency alerts, telemedicine session setup).
- Device plugin test harness with deterministic mock data.
- Load tests for peak dashboards and telemedicine signaling.

Success Measures
- Coverage thresholds met (e.g., 80% lines, 90% critical paths); green pipeline.
- No critical regressions in monthly releases.

---

### 12. Documentation and Developer Experience

Rationale
- Many docs already exist; align and streamline for discoverability.

Key Constraints
- Onboarding new contributors; avoiding doc drift.

Proposed Changes
- Create an index doc linking Architecture, Migration Playbook, API Guide, Device Plugins, Compliance, Deployment Guides.
- Add living ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for major choices (plugin system, API versioning, auth model, migration strategy).
- Keep quick_start_guide.md and application_setup_guide.md current; add troubleshooting FAQs.

Success Measures
- New devs onboard in ≤ 1 day; reduced “tribal knowledge” dependencies.

## Phased Roadmap (High-Level)

- Now (0–4 weeks):
  - Telemedicine core flows; analytics MVP; a11y CI; migration CI checks; mock device plugins; logging redaction.
- Next (1–3 months):
  - Real device plugins (Fitbit, Omron); lab integration (global providers); i18n base; RBAC hardening; API v1 contracts.
- Later (3–6 months):
  - ABDM and Indian pharmacy adapters; advanced AI analytics; BI pipeline; international device bundles; canary deploys.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Schema drift: CI drift checks; ADR on migration policy.
- Compliance gaps: Periodic audits; least-privilege review; incident runbook.
- Vendor API changes: Plugin isolation; contract tests; feature flags.
- Performance regressions: Performance budgets and monitoring; caching strategy review.

This plan synthesizes the repository’s documented goals and constraints into actionable themes with clear rationale and measurable outcomes. It is designed for incremental delivery, regulatory alignment, and long-term maintainability.
