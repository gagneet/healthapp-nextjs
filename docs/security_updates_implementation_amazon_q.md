# ‚úÖ Security Issue Resolutiom

What I Fixed:

1. Added sanitization function - sanitizeForLog() that removes/escapes dangerous characters
2. Applied sanitization - Both filePath and lineNumber are now sanitized before logging
3. Defense-in-depth approach - Even though risk was low, we implemented proper security practices

Security Benefits:

- Prevents log forging - No ability to inject newlines or control characters
- Escapes HTML entities - Prevents potential XSS if logs are viewed in web interfaces
- Input validation - Ensures all inputs are properly stringified and sanitized

Why This Matters:

Even in development scripts, following secure coding practices:

- Sets good precedent for the team
- Prevents future security debt
- Shows security-conscious development approach
- Satisfies static analysis tools like Amazon Q Developer

The script now follows security best practices while maintaining its functionality for fixing TypeScript indexing errors. Great catch on the security analysis! üõ°Ô∏è
