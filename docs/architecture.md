# Doctor Application for Adherence Notes

I'll help you build comprehensive documentation for your health adherence system. Given the complexity and scope, I'll create a detailed requirements document with technology recommendations, epic/story breakdowns, and additional suggestions for robustness.I've created comprehensive documentation for your health adherence system. Here are my key recommendations based on your requirements:

## **Technology Stack Assessment**

Your proposed stack (React + Node/Express + MySQL/PostgreSQL + MongoDB) is solid, but I'd suggest some refinements:

### **âœ… Keep:**

- **React** - Excellent choice, especially with TypeScript and Next.js
- **Node.js/Express** - Good for rapid development and JavaScript ecosystem consistency
- **PostgreSQL** - Perfect for healthcare data integrity and complex relationships

### **ðŸ”„ Consider Changing:**

- **Skip MongoDB** - Healthcare data is highly relational. PostgreSQL can handle JSON documents when needed, reducing complexity
- **Add Redis** - Essential for session management, caching, and real-time features
- **Consider TypeScript** - Critical for healthcare applications to reduce bugs

## **Mobile Notifications Strategy**

For robust mobile notifications and alerts:

1. **React Native** - Shares code with web React, reducing development time
2. **Firebase Cloud Messaging** - Reliable push notifications across platforms  
3. **Background Tasks** - For critical medication reminders even when app is closed
4. **Escalating Alerts** - Multiple notification channels (push â†’ SMS â†’ call) for critical missed items

## **Key Recommendations for Healthcare Context**

### **Security & Compliance:**

- HIPAA compliance must be built-in from day one, not added later
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all data access
- Use encryption at rest and in transit
- Consider AWS/Google Cloud healthcare-specific services

### **Clinical Safety:**

- Implement drug interaction checking
- Add clinical decision support features
- Ensure clear liability boundaries (this is care coordination, not medical diagnosis)
- Include emergency contact escalation for critical missed items

### **User Experience:**

- Focus heavily on mobile-first design for patients
- Implement offline capability for critical functions
- Use voice input for easier data entry
- Add barcode scanning for medications

This breaks everything down into manageable epics and stories. A logical, experimental approach where each phase builds on the previous one, allowing you to validate assumptions and iterate based on real user feedback.

## Architecture

Comprehensive diagrams and workflow charts to visualize the architecture and database schema for the health adherence system. Here are the key highlights:

## **Key Architectural Decisions Explained**

### **1. Database Design**

- **Single PostgreSQL database** instead of mixing with MongoDB - healthcare data is highly relational and benefits from ACID compliance
- **UUID primary keys** for better distributed system support and security
- **Soft deletes** for all user-facing data to maintain audit trails
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for HIPAA compliance
- **Multi-tenancy support** at the organization level

### **2. Service Architecture**

- **Microservices approach** with clear separation of concerns
- **API Gateway** for centralized authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- **Event-driven notifications** for real-time patient engagement
- **Redis for caching and sessions** to handle high-frequency operations

### **3. Mobile-First Considerations**

- **React Native** for code sharing with web frontend
- **Offline-first architecture** with SQLite for critical data
- **Background task processing** for medication reminders
- **Push notification escalation** (push â†’ SMS â†’ call) for critical items

## **Implementation Priority Recommendations**

### **Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Core Foundation**

1. Start with the User Authentication system and basic RBAC
2. Implement Patient and Healthcare Provider management
3. Build the basic dashboard for doctors with patient lists

### **Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Care Management**

1. Implement Care Plans and Medications management
2. Build the notification scheduling system
3. Create basic mobile app with medication reminders

### **Phase 3 (Months 3-4): Patient Engagement**

1. Add vital signs recording and symptom tracking
2. Implement the adherence tracking system
3. Build patient mobile dashboard

### **Phase 4 (Months 4-6): Advanced Features**

1. Add analytics and reporting
2. Implement subscription/billing system
3. Build template system for care plans

## **Critical Technical Considerations**

### **HIPAA Compliance**

- All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Implement comprehensive audit logging (every data access)
- Use BAA-compliant cloud services (AWS/Google Cloud healthcare APIs)
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### **Performance & Scalability**

- The adherence tracking will generate massive amounts of data - consider partitioning by date
- Use Redis for real-time dashboards and notifications
- Implement proper database indexing for patient searches and analytics queries

### **Real-time Requirements**

- WebSocket connections for live dashboard updates
- Push notification infrastructure with fallback mechanisms
- Background job processing for scheduled reminders

The architecture I've designed supports your experimental, logical approach by providing clear interfaces between components, making it easy to test individual features and iterate based on user feedback.

## Architecture Upgrade to Multi-tenancy and PostgreSQL

Completed Architecture Separation:

### Doctor vs HSP Separation

- Doctor Model: Full medical capabilities including prescribing, diagnosing, creating treatment/care plans
- HSP Model: Role-based capabilities (Nurses, PAs, etc.) with appropriate supervision requirements
- Different verification processes and capability validation for each type

### Treatment Plans vs Care Plans

- Treatment Plans: Short-term, acute issues for outpatient visits (only doctors can create)
- Care Plans: Long-term chronic condition management (both doctors and qualified HSPs can create)
- Distinct models with appropriate fields and timelines for each use case

### Enhanced Authorization System

- Created comprehensive middleware (providerCapability.js) to validate:
  - Provider capabilities based on role type
  - Supervision requirements for HSPs
  - Patient access permissions
  - Prescription authority validation

### Updated Database Schema

- Patient Model: Now supports both doctor and HSP primary care providers
- User Model: Enhanced with HIPAA compliance fields and security features
- PostgreSQL Features: UUIDs, JSONB fields, GIN indexes, proper constraints

### Model Associations

- Proper relationships between Users, Doctors, HSPs, Patients
- HSP supervision by doctors
- Care team management across both provider types
- Multi-tenant organization support

The architecture now properly reflects healthcare regulatory requirements where doctors have full medical authority while HSPs (like nurses, PAs) have specific, role-based capabilities with appropriate supervision when needed. Treatment plans handle acute issues while care plans manage long-term chronic conditions, exactly as the user requested.
