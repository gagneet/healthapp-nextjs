  - Distance calculation using Haversine formula
  - Nearby clinic search functionality
  - Location accuracy assessment

API Endpoints:

- POST /api/doctors/clinics/:clinicId/geocode - Manual geocoding
- GET /api/doctors/clinics/nearby - Find nearby clinics
- POST /api/doctors/reverse-geocode - Reverse geocoding

Frontend Components:

- AddressInputWithGeocoding.tsx - Intelligent address input with real-time validation
  - Visual geocoding status indicators (success/error/pending)
  - Automatic address formatting and validation
  - Integration with backend geocoding API
  - Mobile-responsive design

Clinic Management Page:

- /app/dashboard/doctor/clinics/page.tsx - Complete clinic management
  - Geo-location status display with coordinates
  - Location verification buttons and status
  - Integrated address input with geocoding
  - Real-time location accuracy display

‚úçÔ∏è Signature Upload Functionality

Existing Infrastructure:

- Doctor profile API already supported signature upload via /api/doctors/profile/images
- Multer file upload handling in place
- AWS S3 integration ready for signature storage

Frontend Components:

- Supports both drawing and uploading signature images
- Automatic upload to existing backend infrastructure
- State management for different signature modes

üîß Technical Implementation Quality

Consistency Across Layers:

- Database schema properly supports all frontend fields
- Backend API endpoints handle all geo-location operations
- Frontend components integrate seamlessly with backend services
- Proper error handling and validation at each layer

Performance Optimizations:

- Database indexes for efficient geo-spatial queries
- Connection pooling for scalable API performance
- Optimized React components with proper state management
- Caching-ready service architecture

Code Quality:

- Fixed syntax and ESLint issues
- Modern ES module patterns throughout
- TypeScript definitions for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

Both features are now production-ready and fully integrated into the Healthcare Management Platform.
