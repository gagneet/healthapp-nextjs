### üß† Doctor & Provider Logic

- **Doctor Login Profiles**
  - If doctor is linked to a **Provider**, then:
    - Add hospital name automatically as read-only field during patient creation.
    - Show relevant provider banner/logo in prescription and care plan.
  - If doctor is independent:
    - Allow selection or registration of a **Clinic** profile.
    - Optionally link to a provider for specialist collaboration.

- **Provider Dropdown (Read-only)**
  - Shown during **Add New Patient** form if logged in via Doctor/Provider HSP admin.
  - Pulled from relational database mapping Provider ID ‚Üí Doctor.

  - Doctor profile photo
  - Signature (optional)
  - Clinic/Provider banner
- Export as downloadable PDF, triggered from doctor panel.
- Option to include patient details, date, medication, and care instructions.

### üì± Mobile App Considerations

- All interactive elements (Symptom figure, uploads, reminders, etc.) should be mobile-friendly and touch-optimized.
- Push notifications for meds, vitals, and appointments.
- Body selector for pathology symptoms built using SVG/Canvas with hotzones.

---

### üîß Backend & Data Layer Notes

- Use normalized relational schema for:
  - Patients, Doctors, Providers, Clinics
  - Care Plans ‚Üí linked sub-entities (meds, vitals, etc.)
  - Timeline events (symptom logs, vitals, appointments)
- Permissions hierarchy:
  - Doctor (Own patients)
  - Secondary Doctor (Linked patients via specialist assignment)
  - Provider Admin (Global access within org)
