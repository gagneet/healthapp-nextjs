---

I have provided the answers below. Please create a summary .MD file for all the items which you implment and those which we want to keep on hold and implement later (docs/features_implemented_on_hold.md)

## Critical Questions Before Implementation of the Scheduling System

### 1. Appointment Management System

- Scheduling Logic: Should appointments support recurring appointments (weekly/monthly), or just one-time bookings?
  A: They need to support both.
  B: Care & Treatment Plans will have recurring appointments, but will depend on the "Service", and it could be a single or multiple appointments with a one-time or re-occuring one)
  C: Doctor and HSP user should be able to add a single one-time appointment and later make them recurring

- Time Slots: What's the preferred appointment duration granularity (15min, 30min, 60min intervals)?
  A: 10mins, 15mins & 30mins

- Availability: Should doctors set individual availability schedules, or use organization-wide templates?
  A: This is a bit complex and would like suggestions on how to handle it
    - If the Doctor is booking for his Individual or Clinic, then it needs to be based on the Clinic hours and the Doctor's availabllity based on Individual or Clinic calendar
    - If the Doctor belongs to a Hospital/Provider, then it should be based on the the organization-wide templates , setup by the Hospital/Provider Admins

- Patient Booking: Can patients self-book appointments, or must they go through doctor/HSP approval?
  A: No, they have to go through the Doctor/HSP approvals
  B: If they are going to a Doctor with a Provider, then they need to go through the Provider Admins

- Cancellation Policy: What's the cancellation window (24hr, 48hr notice required)?
  A: 24 hours or earlier
  B: After 24 hours (less then 23 hours 59 mins), the appointment cannot be shifted, but lapses, if it is part of a Care Plan
  C: If not part of Care Plan, then Patient can call and the Doctor (for individual or Clinic) and/or Provider Admin can move an appointment 30 mins before the appointment is due.
  D: If less than 30 mins, then the appointment cannot be shifted and a new one has to be created, but for Care Plan appointment, it lapses and no new appointment can be setup, it has to be paid and setup as part of a new Care Plan

### 2. Subscription & Payment System

- Payment Provider: Should I implement Stripe specifically, or design for multiple payment providers?
  A: Please design for multiple Payment Providers in mind.
  B: India has RazorPay, so maybe implement with RazorPay and Stripe first

- Billing Cycles: What billing frequencies should be supported (monthly, quarterly, annual)?
  A: Build for monthly & quarterly for Doctor Individual/Clinic
  B: Build for monthly, quarterly & yearly for Providers/Hospitals

- Service Plans: Should service plans be per-doctor, per-organization, or per-patient?
  A: Service Plans are for per Doctor. They should have the Doctor Name linked and used as a non-editable prt of the name of the Service Plan
  B: If the Doctor belongs to a Provider/Hospital, then all Doctor's can share and see it and use the same template for building their own

- Trial Periods: Do you want free trial functionality built-in?
  A: Build the functionality, it should be configurable for upto 1 week/7 days
  B: Research this from details on the web and put in those guidelines, as are suitable for Medical Healthcare

- Failed Payments: How should failed payment retries and account suspension work?
  A: Follow the guidelines available on the web.
  B: Research this from details on the web and put in those guidelines, as are suitable for Medical Healthcare

### 3. Enhanced Medication Management

- Adherence Tracking: Should this integrate with IoT devices (smart pill bottles), or focus on patient self-reporting?
  A: Currently focus on Patient self-reporting
  B: Keep the option open for integration with other IoT devices

- Reminder System: SMS, email, or push notification preferences for medication reminders?
  A: Would prefer all methods that can be incorporated - SMS, Email and Push Notifications
  B: Keep the options open to add others as we find them

- Drug Interaction Checking: Should I integrate with external drug databases (FDA, RxNorm), or use internal data?
  A: I am not sure about this. Internal for sure for now
  B: Research this from details on the web and put in those guidelines, as are suitable for Medical Healthcare
  C: If there are any free databases available, then please use those also.
  D: We had used Algolia for a search index of Medicines, maybe explore that path also to upload the database there?

- Refill Management: Should the system handle automatic refill requests to pharmacies?
  A: Yes, add this as an option for later implementation.
  B: Research this from details on the web and put in those guidelines, as are suitable for Medical Healthcare
  C: Build a mock for this and we can implement it later?

### 4. Technical Architecture

- External Integrations: Are there specific healthcare APIs I should integrate with (Epic, Cerner, FDA APIs)?
  A: Keep this option open for later implmentation

- Data Migration: Do you need migration scripts from the old Express.js system, or start fresh?
  A: Start fresh, you can reference details from the old Express.js system. But I think all those have already been incorporated.
  B: Can you check what the gaps are, as you had already done this in the previous session?

- Real-time Features: Should appointment bookings, medication adherence updates use WebSocket/real-time updates?
  A: Yes please
  B: Research this from details on the web and put in those guidelines, as are suitable for Medical Healthcare
