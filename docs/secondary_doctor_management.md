# Secondary Doctor Management System - Complete Implementation ‚úÖ

## Overview

The Secondary Doctor Management System enables healthcare organizations to assign multiple doctors to a single patient while maintaining the primary doctor relationship. This system supports complex healthcare workflows with different types of doctor assignments and proper consent management.

## System Architecture

### Database Model (PatientDoctorAssignment.js) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Complex doctor-patient assignment model with 4 assignment types:**

1. **Primary**: Original doctor who created the patient (unchangeable)
2. **Specialist**: For specific care plans/conditions with full medical capabilities  
3. **Substitute**: Same organization coverage, configurable permissions
4. **Transferred**: Requires patient OTP consent, full access after consent

**Key Features:**
- Granular permission system with automatic permission assignment based on type
- OTP consent verification system (6-digit, 30-minute expiration)
- Organization-based access controls for substitute doctors
- Care plan specific assignments for specialists
- Comprehensive audit trail and assignment history

### Service Layer (SecondaryDoctorService.js) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Complete business logic implementation:**
- **Assignment Operations**: Create, read, update, deactivate assignments
- **Permission Validation**: Automatic permission assignment based on doctor type
- **Consent Workflows**: OTP generation, verification, and status management
- **Access Verification**: Real-time doctor-patient access checking
- **Organization Validation**: Same-organization requirements for substitute doctors

**Key Methods:**
- `assignSecondaryDoctor()` - Create new doctor assignments with all validations
- `getPatientDoctorAssignments()` - Retrieve all assignments for a patient
- `verifyPatientConsent()` - Handle OTP verification process
- `canDoctorAccessPatient()` - Real-time access verification
- `updateAssignmentPermissions()` - Granular permission management

### Controller Layer (secondaryDoctorController.js) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive validation:**
- Authentication and authorization middleware integration
- Input validation using express-validator
- Standardized error handling and response formatting
- Role-based access control for all endpoints

### Routes (secondaryDoctorRoutes.js) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Full API route definitions with validation middleware:**
- CRUD operations for doctor assignments
- Patient consent request and verification endpoints
- Doctor access verification endpoints
- Permission management endpoints

### Database Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Complete database integration:**
- Model associations updated in `associations.js`
- Added to model exports in `index.js`
- Comprehensive migration file `20250105120000-create-patient-doctor-assignments.js`
- Proper indexing, constraints, and unique keys
- UUID primary keys and foreign key relationships

### API Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Routes integrated into main application:**
- Added to main router in `src/routes/index.js`
- All endpoints follow established response patterns
- Consistent with existing API architecture

## Permission Matrix

| Assignment Type | View Patient | Create Care Plans | Modify Care Plans | Prescribe | Order Tests | Access History |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Primary**    | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ             |
| **Specialist** | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ             |
| **Substitute** | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå                | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ             |
| **Transferred**| ‚úÖ*          | ‚úÖ*               | ‚úÖ*               | ‚úÖ*       | ‚úÖ*         | ‚úÖ*            |

*Only after patient consent is granted

## Consent Workflow

### Transfer Doctor Assignment Process:
1. **Primary doctor** initiates transfer request
2. **System** generates 6-digit OTP (30-minute expiration)
3. **Patient** receives OTP via SMS/Email
4. **Patient** verifies OTP to grant consent
5. **Transferred doctor** gets full access after consent
6. **System** logs all consent activities for audit

## Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- **Database Layer**: Complete model with relationships and constraints
- **Service Layer**: All business logic and validation methods
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive validation
- **Permission System**: Granular access control based on assignment types
- **Consent System**: OTP generation, verification, and status tracking

## Usage Examples

### Assign a Specialist Doctor
```javascript
const assignment = await SecondaryDoctorService.assignSecondaryDoctor({
  patientId: 'patient-uuid',
  doctorId: 'specialist-uuid', 
  assignmentType: 'specialist',
  assignedBy: 'primary-doctor-uuid',
  specialtyFocus: ['cardiology'],
  carePlanIds: ['care-plan-uuid'],
  assignmentReason: 'Cardiac consultation required'
});
```

### Verify Patient Consent
```javascript
const result = await SecondaryDoctorService.verifyPatientConsent(
  'assignment-uuid',
  '123456'  // OTP entered by patient
);
```

### Check Doctor Access
```javascript
const access = await SecondaryDoctorService.canDoctorAccessPatient(
  'doctor-uuid', 
  'patient-uuid'
);
console.log(access.canAccess); // true/false
```

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Features
- **Audit Logging**: All assignment operations logged with user, timestamp, and action
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with principle of least privilege  
- **Consent Management**: Patient consent tracking for sensitive operations
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data handled securely
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling for all operations

### Security Validations
- **Permission Validation**: Real-time access verification before any operation
- **Organization Validation**: Same-organization requirements enforced
- **Consent Validation**: OTP verification with expiration handling
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks on OTP verification
