## Database Model (PatientDoctorAssignment.js)

- Complex doctor-patient assignment model with 4 assignment types:
- Primary: Original doctor who created the patient
- Specialist: For specific care plans/conditions
- Substitute: Same organization coverage, view-only by default
- Transferred: Requires patient OTP consent
- Granular permission system with automatic permission assignment
- OTP consent verification system for transfers
- Organization-based access controls

## Service Layer (SecondaryDoctorService.js)

- Complete business logic for all assignment operations
- Permission validation and consent workflows
- Doctor access verification methods
- Assignment lifecycle management (create, update, deactivate)

## Controller Layer (secondaryDoctorController.js)

- RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Role-based access control integration

## Routes (secondaryDoctorRoutes.js)

- Full API route definitions with validation middleware
- Endpoints for assignment CRUD, consent management, access verification

## Database Integration

- Updated model associations in associations.js
- Added model to index.js exports
- Created comprehensive migration file
- Proper indexing and constraints

## API Integration

- Added routes to main router with documentation
- All endpoints follow established patterns

## Key Features Implemented
