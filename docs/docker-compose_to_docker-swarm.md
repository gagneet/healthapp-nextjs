# Docker Compose to Docker Swarm Migration Notice

## ⚠️ Important: Deployment Method Changed

This Healthcare Application now uses **Docker Swarm exclusively** for deployment. Docker Compose is no longer supported.

## Why Docker Swarm?

✅ **Enterprise-grade scaling**: Horizontal scaling with load balancing  
✅ **Zero-downtime updates**: Rolling deployments with health checks  
✅ **High availability**: Multi-replica services with automatic failover  
✅ **Production ready**: Built-in load balancing and service discovery  
✅ **Kubernetes preparation**: Easy migration path to Kubernetes  

## Migration Guide

### If You Were Using Docker Compose

**Old Commands:**

```bash
# OLD - No longer supported
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose scale backend=3
```

**New Docker Swarm Commands:**

```bash
# NEW - Docker Swarm approach
./scripts/docker-swarm-init.sh          # One-time setup
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh dev            # Deploy
docker service logs healthapp_backend -f # View logs
docker service scale healthapp_backend=3 # Scale service
docker stack rm healthapp                # Remove deployment
```

### Updated Documentation

All documentation has been updated to reflect Docker Swarm:

- ✅ **README.md** - Updated with Docker Swarm commands
- ✅ **README-Docker-Swarm.md** - Complete Docker Swarm guide
- ✅ **docs/docker_deployment_guide.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide
- ✅ **docs/docker_implementation.md** - Technical implementation details
- ✅ **DOCKER_README.md** - Migration notice (deprecated)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize Docker Swarm (one-time)
./scripts/docker-swarm-init.sh

# 2. Deploy development environment
./scripts/deploy-stack.sh dev --auto-yes

# 3. Scale services as needed
docker service scale healthapp_backend=5
docker service scale healthapp_frontend=3

# 4. Monitor services
docker stack services healthapp
docker service logs healthapp_backend -f
```

### Service Management

```bash
# View all services
docker stack services healthapp

# Scale backend and frontend
docker service scale healthapp_backend=10 healthapp_frontend=5

# View service health
docker service ps healthapp_backend --no-trunc

# Update service configuration
docker service update --env-add NEW_VAR=value healthapp_backend

# Remove entire stack
docker stack rm healthapp
```

### Benefits You Get

1. **Better Scalability**: Easily scale from 1 to 50+ replicas
2. **Load Balancing**: Automatic traffic distribution
3. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and recovery
4. **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime deployments
5. **Multi-Node Support**: Run across multiple servers
6. **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade container orchestration

## Getting Help

- **Complete guide**: See [README-Docker-Swarm.md](../README-Docker-Swarm.md)
- **Deployment guide**: See [docs/docker_deployment_guide.md](./docker_deployment_guide.md)
- **Commands reference**: All docs now use Docker Swarm commands
- **Scaling examples**: Comprehensive scaling documentation provided

The migration ensures your Healthcare Application deployment is production-ready with enterprise-grade scalability!
